1. The sun comes up
The sun goes down
But everything stays the same
It's the same old movie
Or the same old song
Only the players change
It's either 9 to 5
Or work all night
Everybody's got to pay their dues
One half are wrong
One half are right
Sometimes you win
Sometimes you lose

Saying me oh my
We all got to try
To stay alive
And we'll get by
If we all try
To stay alive

There's problems here
There's problems there
We got confusion everywhere
We're all working for a meal
Or to get a better deal
You only want what's fair
I'm stuck on stage
You're stuck at home
Everybody wants to trade places
So I'll be you and you be me
Nothing changes except the faces

Chorus

Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive
Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive

Repeat 1

Chorus

Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive
We got to stay alive, stay alive, stay alive
Me oh my, we all got to try
We got to try to stay alive
We got to get by, we all got to try
We all got to try, we got to stay alive
We got to survive, saying me oh my
We all got to try, to stay, stay alive
We all got to try, to get by and stay alive
Stay alive x9
We got to survive, we all got to try
To stay alive, alive, alive
We got to got try to survive
We all got to try to get by, to get by and get by
We got to try and stay alive
