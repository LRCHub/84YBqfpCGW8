[00:27.21] Come on down, the furthest reaches of your nowhere town
[00:39.88] They suck you in, the black hole kids won't let you free again
[01:10.88] 
[00:52.45] Don't you try to shoot up the sky
[00:59.31] Tonight we'll stay alive
[01:11.31] 
[01:28.03] When it's gone, you sit and stare
[01:33.11] Until the golden dawn
[01:40.17] Can't you see his arms are a hell and you won't ever leave?
